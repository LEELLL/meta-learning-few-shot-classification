# ML-course project

Meta learning for few-shot learning task, using ResNet-18

based on https://github.com/floodsung/LearningToCompare_FSL

Download images for mini-image-net from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Irx3uQNoBMQ1FlNXJsZUdYWEE/view and put it in datas/miniImagenet directory and run proc_images.py

Put all the files in your Google drive under the directory 'ML project'.

You can run both notebooks step by step to see how both models (baseline and ResNet-18 feature extraction) perform. For evaluation, the trained networks are saved in the models directory. Enjoy!
